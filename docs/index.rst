4chan Python Library
====================
*BASC-py4chan* is a Python library that gives access to the 4chan API and an object-oriented way to browse and get board and thread information quickly and easily.

Originally written by `Edgeworth <https://github.com/e000/py-4chan>`_, the library has been adopted and extended by `Bibliotheca Anonoma <https://github.com/bibanon>`_.

.. WARNING::
    If you have an old application written to use the original py4chan, `Bibliotheca Anonoma <https://github.com/bibanon>`_ also maintains a `py-4chan fork <https://github.com/bibanon/py-4chan>`_ on legacy support, only to be updated for URL changes without any new features. This fork is also linked to the `original PyPi package <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/py-4chan>`_, and updating py-4chan using pip will give you the latest version of this fork.

    However, we recommend that **all users** switch to the new BASC-py4chan. This module is more Pythonic, has better support, documentation, and will be gaining new features.

The BASC-py4chan repository is located `on Github <https://github.com/bibanon/BASC-py4chan>`_, where pull requests and issues can be submitted.
