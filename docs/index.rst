BASC-py4chan - 4chan Python Library
===================================
BASC-py4chan is a Python library that gives access to the 4chan API and an object-oriented way to browse and get board and thread information quickly and easily.

Originally written by `Edgeworth <https://github.com/e000/py-4chan>`_, the library has been adopted and extended by `Bibliotheca Anonoma <https://github.com/bibanon>`_.

We're currently writing up the documentation for this module, so stick with us while we flesh out the library documentation and the rest of it!
