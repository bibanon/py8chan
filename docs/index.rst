8chan Python Library
====================
*py8chan* is a Python library that gives access to the 8chan API and an object-oriented way to browse and get board and thread information quickly and easily.

py8chan is based on `BASC-py4chan <https://github.com/bibanon/BASC-py4chan>`_, a 4chan API wrapper that was adopted and extended by the `Bibliotheca Anonoma <https://github.com/bibanon>`_.

The py8chan repository is located `on Github <https://github.com/bibanon/py8chan>`_, where pull requests and issues can be submitted.
