8chan/vichan Python Library
===========================
The Bibliotheca Anonoma's **complete Python Wrapper for the 8chan API.**
Uses requests, respects if-modified-since headers on updating threads.
Caches thread objects. Fun stuff.

An absolute must if you want to interface with or scrape from 8chan or other vichan-based imageboards/textboards,
using a Python script._

Documentation
-------------

This library mostly extends the classes of `BASC-py4chan <https://github.com/bibanon/BASC-py4chan>`_, but has some differences. See the py8chan documentation for more info.

`py8chan Documentation <http://py8chan.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_

Notice that some functions are not implemented in the 8chan API. These functions will `raise an AttributeError when used. <http://stackoverflow.com/a/23126260>`_
