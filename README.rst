8chan/vichan Python Library
===========================
The Bibliotheca Anonoma's **complete Python Wrapper for the 8chan API.**
Uses requests, respects if-modified-since headers on updating threads.
Caches thread objects. Fun stuff.

An absolute must if you want to interface with or scrape from 8chan or other vichan-based imageboards/textboards,
using a Python script._

    recent_thread = board.get_all_thread_ids()[0]
    thread = board.get_thread(recent_thread)

Documentation
-------------

This library mostly extends the classes of `BASC-py4chan <https://github.com/bibanon/BASC-py4chan>`_, but has some slight but major differences. See the py8chan documentation for more info.
